The user stories capture the client's needs and want. Initially, they are captured by the product owner's meeting with the client. Later, it gets refined in backlog refinement meetings to make it clearer. The user stories are dynamic in nature and undergo changes based on the requirements and agile team understandings. The key point is that user stories are essential for developers to work on any client's needs. From the testers' perspective, they use user stories to write the test cases. It makes all agile teams involved in the project from the very beginning.

  

I have learned a lot from this course about the agile development process. One of the most important things I learned is that the requirements can be changed and the team should be prepared for that. I like the idea of two pizza rule. It makes the team manageable and team members can interchange between the team so that they can learn different areas. Also, estimation even if it is rough is key to success. The estimation is needed to make the team focus on the common goal. The estimation is subject to change. However, the estimation gets improved as the team gets more exposure to the agile framework.

  

For me, a good team member is one who is transparent, communicates about their work, and accepts the mistakes if any. Failure is not necessarily a bad thing but hiding it is bad. Also, an ideal team member should be able to accept healthy advice and not criticize others. There are alternatives to the criticism that the team member should use. I would say, constructive criticism actually motivates the team member.
